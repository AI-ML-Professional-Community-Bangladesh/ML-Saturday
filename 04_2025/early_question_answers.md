This document addresses the early questions collected for the ML Saturday session. The question sheet contains around 57 questions, and Iâ€™ll be merging similar ones to answer them together. You can find the question sheet [here](https://github.com/AI-ML-Professional-Community-Bangladesh/ML-Saturday/blob/main/04_2025/early_questions.md).

# Questions & Answers
---

- Q1. What is the proper roadmap to learn AI/ML from scratch?
- Q3. What are the basic preparations to start learning ML (e.g., Python, math, statistics)?
- Q5. How can I strengthen my fundamental knowledge of AI/ML?


#### âœ… **Prerequisites**
- **Programming:** Learn at least one programming language. **Python** is highly recommended due to its popularity and ecosystem in ML.
- **Python Tools:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Python venv. You can learn from official documentation or youtube video.
- **Mathematics:** Develop a solid understanding of core computer science mathematics, including: Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics, Discrete Mathematics, Information Theory, Calculus, etc.
- **Good Practices:** Using virtual environment (venv) for dependency management, functional and moduler coding (Python functions/mehtods and modules), Git & GitHub version control.

Most of these math topics are typically covered in a Computer Science bachelor's curriculum. However, even if you're revisiting them, try not to spend too much time upfront. Instead, learn them alongside practical implementations.

#### ðŸŽ“ **Learning Strategy**
Choose a beginner-friendly YouTube playlist. Some examples are:
- **[100 Days of ML by CampuX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZftI2fEz0Fw&list=PLKnIA16_Rmvbr7zKYQuBfsVkjoLcJgxHH)**.
- **[Complete Machine Learning - by Krish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPrmA1SEN2k&list=PLZoTAELRMXVPBTrWtJkn3wWQxZkmTXGwe)**.
- **[Machine Learning Tutorial Python - by codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmvvaobm7eQ&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw)**.

Start with basic algorithms such as **Linear Regression** and **KNN**. Use a **backward learning** approach:
1. **Watch** a tutorial on an algorithm.
2. **Implement** it using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Explore** the core concepts and underlying math afterward.
4. **Reflect and share** what you've learned by writing blog posts or LinkedIn articles.
This method not only deepens your understanding but also helps during interview preparation.

Slowly complete regression, classification, clustering algorithms. Then start reinforcement learning or deep learning. Complete some projects with kaggle dataset.

#### ðŸ“š **Daily Reading Habit**
Make it a habit to read from a good ML book every day. You can start with:
- *The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book* by **Andriy Burkov**
- *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by **AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron**
These books provide a great mix of theoretical insights and practical examples.
